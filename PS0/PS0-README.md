## Questions

---

**Part of Assignment 0 is to read the collaboration policy in syllabus. If you haven't done this, please do so now. Read the University policy Academic Integrity, and answer the following question:**
**There are six examples of academic misconduct, labeled (a) through (f). Other than (a), "Seeks to claim credit for the work or efforts of another without authorization or citation," which of these do you think would most apply to this class, and why? Write approx. 100-200 words.**
***Note: there is no single correct answer to this. I am looking for your opinion.***

I would say item (f), "assists other students in any of these acts". Students get in touch with other very frequently, complaining about some assignment or a quiz they can't quite finish on their own and ask for help. And well, in many cases students see that they can get away with giving each other the answers. The network of students helping each other cheat through assignments, quizzes, etc. is uncommonly large.

The project is a simple space game. You are a spaceship, avoiding incoming
asteroids.

Move your ship with Arrow keys (←↑→↓ keys). No guns, firing, etc. (yet.)
Collisions are NOT pixel perfect. TODO for later.

Enjoy!
